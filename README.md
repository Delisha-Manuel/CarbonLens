Did you know the average U.S. footprint (around 16 tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year) is over nearly triple the global average (around 4-7 tons)? This means that if every person on Earth lived like the average American, it would require the resources of **five Earths** to sustain that level of consumption!

That’s why I created **CarbonLens** — a web app that uses a **random forest regressor** to predict a user’s carbon footprint based on their input data, and a **large language model (LLM)** to suggest ways for them to reduce it.
